# Custom-sub-ghz-and-IR-codes-for-Flipper-Zero
Just a small project I decided to start with the help of Claude. It's a python program that runs in termux to create custom sub-ghz and IR codes for the Flipper Zero. Not complete!!


As it says above, it does stuff in python. I'm pretty new to this protocol stuff and this is by no means finished. I need to double check the actual values for the examples I have in it already because I just don't trust AI when it comes to this kind of detail and I know there's a bunch wrong. 
    That being said if you find this and see potential, then by all means, grab it and make it better. I have no clue how often I'll come around to do little touch up's here and there but I'll eventually finish it. Anyways, it should be a pretty sweet little program once it's done and for those of you who understand how it works it could end up being an invaluable tool for your completely ethical and legal Flipper stuff ;)
